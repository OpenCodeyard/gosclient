## Getting Started

- This project depends heavily on firebase. A few resources to get you started if this is your first Firebase project:

  * [Lab: Firebase for Flutter](https://firebase.google.com/codelabs/firebase-get-to-know-flutter#0)
  * [FlutterFire Plugins](https://firebase.flutter.dev/)

- A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

  * [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
  * [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

&emsp; For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

- #### Project Setup

  * Flutter App:
    * [Install Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
    * [Setting up your ide](https://flutter.io/ide-setup/)
    * Fork and clone this repository.
    * cd into `ocyclient` directory.
    * Run `flutter clean` command.
    * Run `flutter pub get` command.
    * Run `flutter run` command.
  
  * Firebase:
    * Create a firebase project
    * Add android app with your package name in firebase console.
    * Enable Google Auth from `Authentication` menu in Firebase.
    * Create a file named env and store github_access_token in it (See env_example.txt file in project root for example). Check [this link](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.4/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) to see how to create a github access token. 
    * Generate `SHA-1 key hash` for your debug keystore from your pc. This needs to be added to `SHA certificate fingerprints` section under your android app in `Firebase project settings`. Without this step **Google login** won't work.
    * Enable ***Cloud Firestore***
      * Recommended rules for Firestore 

          ```JS
            rules_version = '2';
            service cloud.firestore {
              match /databases/{database}/documents {
                match /{document=**} {
                  allow read, write: if
                      request.auth != null;
                }
              }
            }
         ```
    * Enable ***Cloud Storage***
    * Download `google_services.json` from `Console` -> `Project Settings`. File is present in app section. SDK instructions found in the same page
    * (Optional) Enable ***Cloud Messaging*** from Firebase Console if you wan't notifications to work in your app
    * (Optional) If released to play store get `SHA-1 key hash` from playstore and upload them to firebase, otherwise google sign in won't work in play store app.
